title: My Journey So Far
---

When I started Bloc, I had some experience under my belt from my self taught days so I got through the first module of the curriculum with very little difficulty. In the second module there was still a lot of hand holding while I built a very simplified music playing app called [Bloc Jams](https://github.com/apmansur/bloc-jams), so although I ran into a couple of road bumps (especially trying to get my seek bars to work) it was not anything I thought was that challenging. 

Jumping a couple weeks later and I am now building a chat room with angularJS and firebase, and things have gotten real real fast haha 

The curriculum has gone from giving you skeleton code you can use to guide you through app building to just a few sentences describing what each part of the app should do. To add to the jump in difficulty I'm am building [Bloc-Chat](https://github.com/apmansur/bloc-chat) with AngularJS, something I am relatively new with. Despite the challenge, I am actually glad that I am finally struggling because this was the whole point in signing up for a bootcamp, to build projects and have an instructor to answer my questions. Not only that but I am getting a lesson in how to debug and troubleshoot my code. Although painful, it has been an invaluable lesson that I am sure I will use in the future when I am on my own writing code. 

When I fianlly complete this project I am sure I will feel a sense of relief haha but also of accomplishment.
