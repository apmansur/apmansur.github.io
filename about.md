Hey there! So you want to know more about me huh? Well here goes, I was born in Barranquilla, Colombia and came to the United States when I was little and, for the most part, grew up in south Florida (a.k.a the best place ever!). Spent most  of my childhood at the beach or in a pool (dat competitive swimmer lyfe) and eventually made my way to Rice University for school.

At Rice I studied chemistry and got involved with research on campus as well as service learning efforts. The highlights of my university career were definitely the opportunities I had to do service, go abroad, and give back to my home country. I was able to lead two [service learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-learning) trips to Guatemala, was accepted for an [iREU](https://global.acs.org/global-programs/global-undergraduate-programs/international-research-experience-for-undergrads-ireu/) in a lab at UPMC in Paris (I know, I know #blessed), and recieved a grant to develop a youth leadership program in [Palermo,Magdalena, Colombia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palermo,+Sitionuevo,+Magdalena,+Colombia/@10.954868,-74.7446437,15.75z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x8ef432cdcabaad3b:0xbabd965043d0d124!2sPalermo,+Sitionuevo,+Magdalena,+Colombia!3b1!8m2!3d10.95775!4d-74.74523!3m4!1s0x8ef432cdcabaad3b:0xbabd965043d0d124!8m2!3d10.95775!4d-74.74523).

Now that I am out of school I am working as a [production chemist](http://www.shell.com/careers/experienced-professionals/technical-careers/production-engineering/production-chemistry.html) at Shell. On the day to day I work out of an office and manage the chemical programs at [unconventional](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uncoventional-oil.asp) assets across the U.S. and Latin America making sure we are making the best decisions for the safety of those involved, the environment, and for the business.  BUT, all that is about to change!!

I am currently working on developing my programing skills so that I can join the tech industry and be a part of making the future! (I know I am super cheesy)
